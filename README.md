# Sleep Tracker Discord Bot

This is a public Bot, that is meant to be used for sleep calls on Discord.
For now all it does, is show how long you have spent with someone in a sleep call.

Main reason i remade this Bot and made it public is that some friends of mine liked the Bot i used for just me and my partner.
I couldnt just let them use that one as well, since it was hard coded and wouldnt work for any other person on any other server. The first version was a "quick and dirty and than forget about it" kinda thing.

## Discord Bot Base

This Bot is made on top of my selfmade base for Discord Bots.
Using this structure and pieces of this Project for anything else is not allowed, unless you have a special agreement with me.
I worked a lot on this base/template. I dont want people just taking it and not even thanking or crediting me.
