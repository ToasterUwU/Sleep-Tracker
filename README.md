# Sleep Tracker Discord Bot

This is a public Bot, that is meant to be used for sleep calls on Discord.
For now, all it does is show how long you have spent with someone in a sleep call.

The main reason I remade this Bot and made it public is that some friends of mine liked the Bot I used for just me and my partner.
I couldn't just let them use that one as well, since it was hard-coded and wouldn't work for any other person on any other server. The first version was a "quick and dirty and then forget about it" kinda thing.
